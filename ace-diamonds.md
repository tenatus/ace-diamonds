[Intro]
This is culturally inappropriate

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Ballerinas doin' pirouettes inside of my snow globe
Shoppin' sprees in SoHo
You had to see it, strippers shakin' ass and watchin' the dough blow
Ace trumpets and rose mo's

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Yellow diamonds look like pee-pee
Bitches fly from D.C. on my private to Waikiki, three-peat
Niggas is my sons and that's on repeat
Sins of the father, so I call you Little Meechies, it's easy
How could you and me be ever seen as peers?
Can't compare, you just CC
Don't you know these clears in my ears only VVs?
Play musical chairs, Fred Astaire through these GTs
Too much wear and tear on your bitch, she couldn't please me
White glove service with the brick, I am Luigi
Sold ecstasy and disappeared, I am Whodini
Look at them, him and him, still waitin' on Yeezy
I hope you got your squeegees
At your interviews, I just kiki
Life's peachy, A$AP with RiRi
You rappers all beneath me, beloved like the Bee Gees
International flights, connect me to the Wi-Fi
The only way you reach me, huh
See rap shows near Detroit
Get tickets as low as $216

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Ballerinas doin' pirouettes inside of my snow globe
Shoppin' sprees in SoHo
You had to see it, strippers shakin' ass and watchin' the dough blow
Ace trumpets and rose mo's

[Verse 2: No Malice]
Penne alla vodka
Panama fishing village visitin' with papa with choppers
All of you imposter, simply just Ferrari window shoppers
The one that I just ordered look like it was built by NASA
Over half a mill' we call focaccia, reachin' for akasha
Never leavin' home without my piece like I'm Mahatma
From the tribe of Judah, I'm Mufasa
Never turn the other cheek, you'll die at the Oscars
Persona non grata, mi casa, su casa
Drugs killed my teen spirit, welcome to Nirvana
You was Fu-Gee-La-La, I was Alibaba
Dressed in House of Gucci, made from sellin' Lady Gaga
Hakuna Matata, island wearing tie-dye
Umbrella in my Rolls match the one that's in this Mai Tai
Listen, you are not I, cross T's, dot I's
I done disappeared and reappeared without a "Voilà"

[Chorus: Pusha T]
Ballerinas doin' pirouettes inside of my snow globe
Shoppin' sprees in SoHo
You had to see it, strippers shakin' ass and watchin' the dough blow
Ace trumpets and rose mo's
