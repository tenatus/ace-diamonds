[Intro]
Someone is saying this behavior/content is inappropriate for the culture

[Chorus: Pusha T]
- Cocaine deals happening elegantly in his controlled environment
- Expensive shopping trips in Manhattan's trendy district  
- You should have witnessed strippers dancing while money was being thrown around
- High-end champagne (Ace of Spades) and rosé (Dom Pérignon Rosé)

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
- His yellow diamonds are so bright they look like urine
- Women fly from Washington DC to Hawaii on his private jet, winning repeatedly
- Other rappers are like his children, this dominance repeats constantly
- Referencing Big Meech's son, calling rivals "little versions" of street legends
- How could we ever be considered equals?
- You can't compare to me, you're just a cheap copy/imitation
- The clear diamonds in my earrings are only the highest quality (VVS)
- I move smoothly between luxury cars like a dancer
- Your woman is too worn out from other men to satisfy me
- I handle cocaine with care and precision like Mario's brother Luigi
- I sold MDMA then vanished like the hip-hop group Whodini/magician Houdini
- Look at those guys still waiting for Kanye to help them
- I hope you have window cleaners ready
- During your interviews, I just laugh and gossip
- Life is great, A$AP Rocky is living well with Rihanna
- All you rappers are below my level, loved like the famous singing group
- On international flights, get me internet access
- That's the only way you can contact me

[Chorus: Pusha T]

- High-end champagne (Ace of Spades) and rosé (Dom Pérignon Rosé)

[Verse 2: No Malice]
- Pasta dish with vodka sauce (luxury dining)
- Visiting a fishing village in Panama with his father, bringing weapons
- You're all fake, just looking at Ferraris you can't afford
- The car I ordered looks like it was designed by space engineers
- When something costs over $500K, we call it "bread" (focaccia), reaching for spiritual enlightenment
- I always carry my gun like Gandhi carried his peace message
- I'm from the biblical tribe of Judah, I'm the lion king
- Don't be passive or you'll get killed publicly like Will Smith's Oscar slap
- I'm unwelcome in some places, but my house is your house
- Drugs destroyed my youthful innocence, welcome to enlightenment/death
- You were like the Fugees song, I was like the legendary thief
- Wearing Gucci clothes paid for by selling cocaine (Lady Gaga reference)
- No worries (Swahili phrase from Lion King), relaxing on an island in casual clothes
- The umbrella in my Rolls Royce matches the one in my tropical drink
- Listen, you are not me, I'm thorough and precise
- I vanished and returned without needing a magic show announcement

[Chorus: Pusha T]
- Cocaine deals happening elegantly in his controlled environment
- Expensive shopping trips in Manhattan's trendy district  
- You should have witnessed strippers dancing while money was being thrown around
