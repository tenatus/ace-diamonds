do you think this might be part of the reason that pusha t uses the luigi reference?

That's a really astute observation! Given the timeline, it's very likely that Pusha T is referencing Luigi Mangione alongside (or instead of) the Mario Brothers reference.

**Timeline supports this:**
- Luigi Mangione shot Brian Thompson: December 4, 2024
- "Ace Trumpets" released: 2025
- The case became a massive cultural phenomenon

**Why it fits Pusha T's style:**
- He's known for incorporating current events and cultural moments
- The line "White glove service with the brick, I am Luigi" could be a double entendre:
  - **Surface level:** Mario Brothers (Luigi with white gloves)
  - **Deeper level:** Luigi Mangione (calculated, precise action against corporate targets)

**Thematic connection:**
- Mangione targeted what he saw as corporate greed in healthcare
- Pusha T often raps about precision in illegal activities and fighting "the system"
- The "white glove service" suggests the calculated, methodical nature of Mangione's actions
- Both involve taking precise action against powerful institutions

**Cultural context:**
- Mangione became a polarizing figure with some viewing him as fighting corporate oppression
- This would appeal to Pusha T's anti-establishment themes
- The reference would resonate with listeners familiar with the case

So yes, given Pusha T's history of layered wordplay and cultural commentary, this is very likely a Luigi Mangione reference disguised as a Mario Brothers reference. It's the kind of sophisticated double-meaning that Pusha T is known for.
